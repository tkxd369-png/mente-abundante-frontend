      <h2>1. Nature of the program and product</h2>
      <p>
        The Master Key is a private, digital personal growth program that includes access to
        online content, video lessons and a private community (the “Program”). Your contribution
        gives you personal access as a member; it does not constitute a financial investment,
        security or guarantee of specific results.
      </p>

      <h2>2. One-time payment and no-refund policy</h2>
      <p>
        Access to The Master Key is activated through a <strong>single, one-time contribution</strong>
        shown on the payment page. By confirming your payment you expressly accept that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>All contributions are <strong>final and non-refundable</strong>.</li>
        <li>
          There are <strong>no partial refunds, no cooling-off period</strong> and no chargebacks
          accepted as a replacement for the internal refund policy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any decision to participate is entirely voluntary and based on your own criteria and expectations.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you do not agree with the no-refund policy or have doubts, you should not complete
        the payment.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Payment processing, Stripe and banks</h2>
      <p>
        Payments and affiliate payouts related to The Master Key may be processed through
        <strong>Stripe, Stripe Connect</strong> and/or your local bank, depending on your country.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Master Key and its operators:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Do not store any card, bank or payment account data.</strong> All sensitive
          payment data is handled directly by Stripe and/or your bank.
        </li>
        <li>
          Only store the personal information needed to create and manage your private account
          (name, email, contact details, country and referral information).
        </li>
        <li>
          Are <strong>not responsible</strong> for additional fees, currency conversion charges,
          payment blocks, delays or losses caused by Stripe, other processors or banks.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This is especially relevant in Latin America and other regions where banks and payment
        providers may apply extra verification processes, exchange rates or local fees.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Referral program</h2>
      <p>
        The Program may include an <strong>internal referral program</strong> that allows active
        members to receive commissions or bonuses when new participants join using their personal
        code or link.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a participant in the referral program you understand and agree that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You must have an active, paid account in The Master Key to be eligible for commissions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Payouts are processed through Stripe Connect and/or your local bank, and may be subject
          to verification, minimum thresholds and payout schedules.
        </li>
        <li>
          Additional fees, currency conversion costs or restrictions from Stripe or your bank
          may apply and are outside the control of The Master Key.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Master Key may adjust, pause or terminate the referral program at any time in order
          to comply with legal, tax or operational requirements.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Use of the content and confidentiality</h2>
      <p>
        All videos, materials, texts, graphics, methods and tools provided inside The Master Key
        are for <strong>personal, non-transferable use</strong> only. You agree not to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Share, resell or publish the content in any public or private platform.</li>
        <li>Record, copy or redistribute the Program materials without written permission.</li>
        <li>
          Present the Program as your own creation or use the brand “The Master Key” or related
          names in a way that may cause confusion.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Personal data and privacy</h2>
      <p>
        The Master Key only collects the personal data necessary to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create and manage your member account.</li>
        <li>Communicate with you about access, updates and internal announcements.</li>
        <li>Track referral relationships and process affiliate payouts where applicable.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your personal data is <strong>not sold or traded</strong> to third parties. Service providers
        such as Stripe or email tools may process your data solely to operate the Program.
      </p>

      <h2>7. No guarantees of results</h2>
      <p>
        The Master Key is a personal growth and transformation program. Every person is different
        and results depend on multiple individual factors. For this reason:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          No specific financial, emotional or life results are guaranteed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Examples, stories or testimonials are illustrative only and do not represent a promise
          or typical result.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Changes to these Terms</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms &amp; Conditions may be updated from time to time. The version in force is the
        one published on this page at the time of your payment or continued use of the Program.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Contact</h2>
      <p>
        If you have questions about these Terms &amp; Conditions or about your access to The Master Key,
        please contact support using the official channels indicated inside the Program.
      </p>

      <p class="tm-terms-note">

        understood and accepted these Terms &amp; Conditions, including the no-refund policy and
