          <p class="gold-note">“Nothing is missing where the Creator is the Source.”</p>
          <p><span class="gold-aside">(You will know the Truth, and you will be truly free.)</span></p>

          <p>Scarcity is not a reality; it is a perception.</p>

          <p>The Creator did not design a limited world.</p>
          <p>He designed a flow of provision that manifests in every sunrise, in every opportunity, and in every breath.</p>

          <p>In every living being, He placed a seed of unlimited provision.</p>
          <p>Observe nature: a single seed can multiply and feed many.</p>
          <p>That same principle lives in you.</p>

          <p>Inside every person there is a gift—unique and unrepeatable—that produces value, creates resources, and generates wellbeing.</p>
          <p>The divine plan was always abundance.</p>

          <p>There is a kind of wealth personally assigned to you.</p>
          <p>No one can touch it.</p>
          <p>No one can take it away.</p>
          <p>Only you can activate it.</p>

          <hr class="soft-divider">

          <p class="gold-note">🌱 When you understand the Source, your relationship with life changes</p>

          <p>When you understand that the Creator is the Source, fear begins to dissolve—along with the need to compete, hoard out of anxiety, or live in constant urgency.</p>

          <p>The Great Teacher said it with clarity:</p>
          <p><span class="gold-aside">(Do not live consumed by anxious striving—look at creation: it is sustained. You are worth more than you think.)</span></p>

          <p>When you believe everything depends on you, you carry a weight you were never meant to carry.</p>
          <p>But when you remember that the Creator is the Source of all good, that weight turns into peace.</p>

          <p>Provision is not limited to money.</p>
          <p>It includes:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>strength when you are tired,</li>
            <li>wisdom when you don’t know what to do,</li>
            <li>connections at the right time,</li>
            <li>ideas that open doors,</li>
            <li>favor you didn’t earn,</li>
            <li>and help that arrives without you forcing it.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Provision is the Creator sustaining what He designed.</p>
          <p>If you were created, you were included.</p>

          <hr class="soft-divider">

          <p class="gold-note">🌿 The greatest battle is internal</p>

          <p>Many people don’t struggle because they lack resources.</p>
          <p>They struggle because they lack certainty.</p>

          <p>The mind thinks:</p>
          <p>“What if I can’t?”</p>
          <p>“What if it doesn’t work?”</p>
          <p>“What if I lose?”</p>
          <p>“What if I’m not enough?”</p>

          <p>And those thoughts produce tension.</p>
          <p>That tension produces desperate decisions.</p>
          <p>And those decisions keep the person trapped in cycles of survival.</p>

          <p class="gold-note">Scarcity begins when the heart forgets its Source.</p>

          <hr class="soft-divider">

          <p class="gold-note">🌱 The Creator is not a limited supply</p>

          <p>The world teaches you to fear lack.</p>
          <p>To compete.</p>
          <p>To protect yourself.</p>
          <p>To believe there isn’t enough.</p>

          <p>But the Creator is not a limited supply.</p>
          <p>He is a living current.</p>

          <p>When you align with that current, provision becomes natural.</p>
          <p>Not always immediate in the way the anxious mind demands—</p>
          <p>but always on time in the way wisdom provides.</p>

          <p>There is a difference between:</p>
          <p>urgency…</p>
          <p>and purpose.</p>

          <p>Between:</p>
          <p>panic…</p>
          <p>and faith.</p>

          <p>Between:</p>
          <p>forcing…</p>
          <p>and receiving.</p>

          <hr class="soft-divider">

          <p class="gold-note">🌿 The blocked channel</p>

          <p>Sometimes pride tells us we must do everything alone.</p>
          <p>Sometimes fear tells us we can’t trust anyone.</p>
          <p>Sometimes control tells us we must predict everything.</p>

          <p>And many times, guilt whispers that we don’t deserve to receive.</p>
          <p>So we believe provision is “for others”—for the smartest, the luckiest, or the “most spiritual.”</p>

          <p>But the Creator does not play favorites.</p>
          <p>His wells are open to all.</p>

          <p>Every sunrise is a silent answer that says:</p>
          <p><span class="gold-aside">(“I have always sustained you… and I always will.”)</span></p>

          <hr class="soft-divider">

          <p class="gold-note">🌿 The Truth That Frees</p>

          <p>Provision does not come from desperate effort, but from conscious faith.</p>
          <p>It does not depend on your capacity, but on your alignment with the Source.</p>

          <p>The Creator is not an intermittent provider;</p>
          <p>He is an infinite current that flows when you open your heart to receive.</p>

          <p>Your role is not to ask in anguish,</p>
          <p>but to live from the certainty that you have already been provided for.</p>

          <p>Life is not about getting more.</p>
          <p>It is about trusting better.</p>

          <p>“The Creator is my unlimited Source; everything I need flows to me in perfect timing.”</p>

          <hr class="soft-divider">

          <p class="gold-note">✨ Today’s Practice</p>
          <p>1️⃣ Write down three moments in your life when you received exactly what you needed—right on time.</p>
          <p>2️⃣ Identify one belief you still carry about lack, and replace it with a truth-based statement.</p>
          <p>3️⃣ Do one small act of generosity today.</p>

          <p class="gold-note">💬 Question for Your Heart</p>
          <p>In what ways have I tried to become my own source?</p>
          <p>When you remember you are not the source, you are freed from fear.</p>
          <p>And when you remember Who is, you will never feel alone—or lacking—again.</p>
